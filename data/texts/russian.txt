Королевство Хайрул пребывает в мире с тех пор, как Линк, последний рыцарь Хайрула, победил злобного Ганона и отвоевал у него бесценный Трифорс.       
Что же Линк пожелал Трифорсу? Никто не может сказать, но Светлый Мир и Темный Мир воссоединились, а потомки Семи Мудрецов вернулись к жизни.
Затем, Линк вернул Трифорс и Меч Мастера Принцессе Зельде, а люди понадеялись на то, что мир продлится долго.[br]Но, люди ошибались...
К сожалению, пожелание Линка имело и нежелательный эффект - Ганон и его приспешники воскресли и приготовились к новой атаке.
Где-то в Лесах Хайрула спал Линк, ничего не подозревающий о том, что Ганон уже перешел в нападение, пока...[br]Не услышал во сне так хорошо знакомый голос...
На помощь![br]Спаси меня![br]Это я![br]Зельда![br]Я взываю к тебе телепатически.
Меня заточили в подземелье замка! Мне нужна твоя помощь![br]Ганон вернулся, и он наверняка уже нашел Трифорс... 
Скорее отправляйся в замок, Линк, ты - моя единственная надежда...

Congratulations Link ! You managed to come and save me !                                        Let's go and find Ganon, we have to take the Triforce back from him!
We'll find Ganon at the end of the secret passage behind the throne room. Let's go!
We're almost there, follow me!
I'm afraid you'll never vanquish Ganon with your current weapons...                             Go explain our problem to Kakariko Village's chief, I'm sure he'll figure a solution.
Ganon is right behind that door. I'll cure you before the fight. 
Ganon is still somewhere in the castle!
Wait for me Link!!!                             You think it's easy, running with high heels ?
Don't you feel like you're forgetting someone?  
Zelda is waiting for you!!!                     She's probably held prisoner in the underground dungeons! 
You got the Triforce!!!
When Link touched the Triforce, all the monsters  disappeared and peace came back.                                                                    Princess Zelda took a great decision : she touched the Triforce to make her wish come true...                                                         The Triforce had always been the seed of all the Kingdom's troubles, sooner or later, some evil doer would have found it.                                                                           But it definitely disappeared from Hyrule the moment princess Zelda touched it. 
Since then, Hyrule's people have lived happy and at peace, with no fear of new disasters.                                                             And that's the end of the legend of Zelda, of the Triforce, and of the Golden Land. It is said that the Master Sword lies safely somewhere as the last memory of Link's quest.
You got the book of Mudora!!!                                                                   From now on, you can understand old Hylian!!!
Congratulations Link, you managed to find me. As a reward, I grant you the medal of Din. It increases your defense by one point. 
Congratulations Link, you managed to find me. As a reward, I grant you the medal of Farore. It increases your defense by one point. 
Congratulations Link, you managed to find me. As a reward, I grant you the medal of Nayru. It increases your defense by two points!!!
I'm going to cure your wounds.
...
Congratulations Link, you managed to find me. As a reward, I double your magic gauge. 
Your magic gauge has doubled!!!
Welcome Link!                                   Let me explain why I'm here.
You may have noticed that monsters have appeared in all Hyrule.                                   I hadn't seen monsters since you defeated Ganon.
Well... I decided to list them all. 
But since I'm too fearful to go and meet them, I need your help.
I need you to vanquish every type of monster and make me a report. I'll give you a reward every 7 types of enemies you vanquish. 
If you want to know how many enemies you vanquished, press [MONSTERS]. 
[v=1] enemies to go before the next reward. 
Only one new type of enemy left before your next reward!!!
Receive this gift as a reward for your help:
I'm sorry, but I have nothing more to give you...
I can't believe it ! You vanquished all types of enemy!!!                                      Congratulations Link!!!
Good morning Link, I'm this village's chief. I expected your arrival.
Monsters have been appearing everywhere since sunrise. I went to tell princess Zelda, but as you may have noticed, a powerful spell forbids all access to the castle...
What ? Ganon's behind all this ? He stole the Triforce and keeps princess Zelda prisoner?
Mmmm... Things are worse than I thought...      We must react quickly, and you have to fight Ganon again! 
How to get into the castle? I may have an idea...
As you know, the 7 wise men's power was locked inside 7 crystals by sorcerer Aghanim when he tried to remove the seal confining Ganon to the dark world. 
Yet, even though you resurrected the wise men's descendants, the crystals kept their power.
They've been hidden in the heart of the 7 temples. Bring them together and you'll be able to bypass Ganon's spell.
It won't be easy, though. Ganon must have sent his best servants to defend the crystals.
Before going for this quest, you need a better equipment. Tell the weapons' seller I sent you, he'll make you a discount. Good luck!
Tell the weapons' seller I sent you, he'll make you a discount.
You need to gather the 7 crystals if you ever want to save Zelda and Hyrule...
You've found the 7 crystals? Then go to the castle, you need to free the princess, she'll know what to do better than me.
Your weapons are powerless against Ganon? Then, you must find the Master Sword. Rumour has it that it's hidden in a hidden temple. 
And also that the way to the cleansing blade goes through a village inhabited by monsters... I wonder if there truly is such a village...     
Any case, you won't find it with your current equipment. You should go to Gerudo village's Smith.
It's time to face Ganon and take back the Triforce from him!

You have no need for that now. 
Thank you.
Choose whatever you want.
Really?                                         The chief sent you in a mission???              Well, I'll make you a little discount on the bow, then...
You already bought the only bow I had. 
Thanks... But that's a bargain for you...
Come back later, I'm overworked!
How can I help you?

Good morning Link, I'm this village's chief.    You should go to the smith and show him some of your equipment if you want him to reforge it. 
I heard of your quest, so I made a deal with him. Everything will be free for you.
Come back when you have an empty bottle and I'll sell you a green potion, to restore your magic.
A green potion for 40 rupees, OK ?                                                                            [c=2]YES[c=0]              NO

Good morning! If you came to see the smith, he lives a little further. 
When you brought peace back to Hyrule and reunited the light world to the Golden Land, Zelda secretly asked willing spirits to create this village to protect a very precious object.
Our village was created to prevent reckless adventurers from going to the temple. I don't give permission to pass to anyone.
Mmmm... You already found 4 crystals?            I must admit I'm impressed...
OK, you may go through the graveyard, but it will be at your own risks !                                                                              
Tell the guard I allowed you to go, and he'll let you pass. 
Oh, you're still alive.                         What a surprise !
The shadow temple is the beginning of a path that leads to a legendary object. This village exists only to deter adventurers from getting to close to it. 
Have you found the sword?                       Yet, I don't think it is yours just because you found it.
The Master Sword is part of Hyrule's most precious heritage, you'll have to bring it back to it's sanctuary once your mission has been completed.
Come back when you have an empty bottle and I'll sell you a blue potion to restore your hearts and your magic.
A blue potion for 160 rupees, OK?                                                                               [c=2]YES[c=0]              NO

This village's inhabitants are spirits who answered to princess Zelda's call.
